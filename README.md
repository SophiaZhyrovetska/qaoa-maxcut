# Solving 2-MaxCut problem with QAOA
Given an undirected unweighted graph, the 2-MaxCut problem can be stated as the problem of partitioning the nodes of a graph into two subsets such that the numberof  edges  between  them  is  as  large  as  possible. 

Here is presented a solution for the MaxCut problem, using the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm.
